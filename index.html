    <li>Trees cover up a multitude of sins. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. We'll do another happy little painting.
  Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.</li>
    <li>Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.
  
  You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Anyone can paint. That easy. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.
  
  That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You are only limited by your imagination. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.</li>
    <li>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll put a happy little sky in here. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Isn't that fantastic?
  
  Use your imagination, let it go. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. It all happens automatically.
  
  We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Let that brush dance around there and play. Brown is such a nice color.</li>
